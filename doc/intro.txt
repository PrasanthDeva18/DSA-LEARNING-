What is DATA?

data is an integral part of our application or program.

what is Program?

Program is an set of instruction which perform operation on data.

Data structure, Data Warehouse, Database, Big Data.

What is Data structure?
arrangement of collection of data items, that they can utilized effecitently.
for the operation on the data effectively.

inside the memory during the execution of program.

how data structures uses?
example

if i click to open the ms word, it will be brought the prog file in main memory and they need doc as well that also brought in main memroy

databases:-
//ecommerce 
arrange the data in some relational model, in the permenent storage 


Big Data:-
using the large data, to take desicion or study is caller big data.

operational data  - they can use daily

legacy data - if required we can use it, historical array of disc - data warehouse

Static Memory vs Dynamic Memory Allocation


memory for 64kb for this entire lesson.

in c and c++ ->  number of bytes taken by the variables depends on the computer hardware or compiler


in memory allocation -> 

static - how many memory need for the function decided at compile time or before runtime is called static memory allocation . 
if program start it will create the activation frame in stack.
size of the memory will be decided in compile time only.

Dynamic Memory Allocation ->

term heap will be used for orgainzed or unorganized things

heap memory treated like resource, when they required use the heap

program cant directly access heap memory

eg :- printer

using the pointer to access heap memory

loss of memory is called memory leak.

int main() {
    int *p;
    p= new int[5];
    p = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * 5);

    delete []p; // c++
    free(p);
    p=NULL;

}
