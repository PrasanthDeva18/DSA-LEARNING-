//Physical DS 
//Logical DS

Physical -> array and linkedlist -> why??
Logical - stack, queue, tree, graph and hash table.

linear - stack , queue
non-linear - tree, graph
tabular - hashing


logical data structure - implemented using physical ds

data type?

representation of data 
operation on data 

eg :- 
int x;

in memory  :- 

integer will represent 2bytes
 total 16 bit 

 1 bit will be allocated for signed bit it will allow postive or negativee

 reamining 15 allow any value.
